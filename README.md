## Introduction

**SuitableLove** is a blockchain-powered dating platform that aims to create deep, authentic relationships by gamifying and incentivizing meaningful interactions. Designed to counter the superficiality of modern dating apps, SuitableLove offers users a unique experience with free unlimited access, secure profiles, and gradual information reveal to promote genuine connections.

## Problem Statement

Traditional dating apps have several core issues:

- **Superficiality of Connections**: Most users make quick decisions based almost entirely on appearance, leading to shallow, fleeting connections.
- **Limitations for Free Users**: Platforms like Tinder impose strict limits on free users, pushing them towards paid features like extra swipes or visibility.
- **Lack of Trust and Privacy Concerns**: Bots, fake profiles, and weak identity verification erode user trust, while personal data is often poorly managed or exploited.

## Solution

**SuitableLove** introduces a new dating experience built on Web3 and blockchain technology:

- **Gradual Profile Reveal**: Users can engage in meaningful conversations before unlocking more detailed information, ensuring that connections are based on real interaction rather than quick judgments.
- **Gamified Engagement**: Users are rewarded for consistent, quality interactions through tokens, incentivizing deeper conversations and longer-lasting connections.
- **Secure and Verified Users**: All users undergo identity verification through **zkLogin (Zero-Knowledge Login)**, ensuring that interactions are genuine, with zero tolerance for bots or fake profiles.

## Added Value

While Tinder and similar apps restrict free users and focus heavily on appearance-based matching, SuitableLove:

- **Provides Free, Unlimited Access**: No paid swipes or hidden costs, allowing all users to enjoy the full experience without coercive monetization.
- **Monetizes through Positive Engagement**: Users earn tokens (Sui) through meaningful interactions, turning dating into a rewarding experience.
- **Promotes Trust and Privacy**: zkLogin and decentralized data storage (using FHE and time-lock encryption) ensure privacy, with user data stored securely and revealed gradually, giving users full control over their information.

## Technology Needed

- **zkLogin (Zero-Knowledge Login)**: Enables secure, seamless identity verification without compromising user privacy. Users can prove their humanity without revealing personal details.
- **Proof of Humanity**: Ensures all profiles are genuine, creating a trustworthy environment for dating.
- **Time-Lock Encryption**: Gradually unlocks user profile details over time, ensuring that deeper information is only revealed after meaningful interactions.
- **Sui Blockchain Integration**: Tokens (Sui) reward users for engagement, while SuiNS is used to provide a SocialFi layer for decentralized incentives.
- **Sponsored Transactions for Onboarding**: Facilitates a smooth onboarding process by covering transaction fees for new users, allowing them to engage with the platform without any upfront costs or barriers.
- **Walrus Storage**: A decentralized storage solution for securely storing user data, such as social media links and additional pictures. It ensures that personal information is stored efficiently and accessed based on predefined conditions.

## Web3 Utility

Web3 enables a new layer of trust, security, and engagement for Suitable.love. By utilizing blockchain-based identity verification and encrypted data storage, the platform provides a level of security and privacy not possible with traditional Web2 apps. Additionally, Web3's decentralized token system offers a fair and engaging way to incentivize user behavior without relying on paid subscriptions or restrictive monetization tactics.

**SuitableLove** is not just another dating app; it's a reimagined platform that puts the user first, ensuring authentic connections and rewarding meaningful engagement through the power of Web3.
