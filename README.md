## Suitable Profile Module

This module defines the core logic for creating and managing user profiles on the Sui blockchain for the dating application. It includes functionality for profile creation, managing likes, and interacting with chat functionality. Exclusive data such as social media links and additional pictures are stored on `Walrus`, and revealed based on certain conditions, while profile metadata is accessible through Suiâ€™s `Display` functionality.

### Module Purpose

The `suitable_profile` module enables users to:
- Create, store, and manage dating profiles.
- Store social information (e.g., pictures, social media links).
- Manage likes and access to exclusive profile data via chats and time-lock encryption.
- Leverage **Sui's display functionality** to show important profile data.
